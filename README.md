# 🛒 E-commerce Recommendation & Clickstream Analytics Platform

This project is a scalable, event-driven system that powers real-time product recommendations and clickstream analytics for an e-commerce platform.\
It combines a Go API, Next.js frontend, Kafka, Redis, and an offline ML pipeline built with Ray and MLflow.

## ✅ **Features**

- Event-driven, loosely coupled architecture.
- Low latency product recommendations via caching.
- Scalable offline training with Ray.
- ML experiment tracking with MLflow.
- Real-time analytics for high-engagement products.

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Go (Gin)
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- Cache: Redis
- ML pipeline: Ray, MLflow
- Containerization: Docker / Docker Compose

## 📦 **Getting Started (Local)**

> Replace this with your actual setup instructions

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ecommerce-platform.git
cd ecommerce-platform

# Start Go API
cd api
go run main.go

# Start Next.js frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Start Kafka & Redis (e.g., with Docker Compose)
docker-compose up
```

## 🚀 **Architecture Overview**

- **Frontend:**
  - Next.js app for product exploration, user browsing, and collecting clickstream events.
- **Backend API:**
  - Go (Gin) service providing:
    - `/search` endpoint for product search & recommendations.
    - `/track` endpoint to log user clickstream events.
    - `/analyze` endpoint to fetch real-time analytics.
- **Streaming & caching:**
  - Kafka handles event ingestion.
  - Redis caches:
    - Precomputed recommendations.
    - Aggregated real-time analytics.
- **Offline recommendation pipeline:**
  - Ray tasks consume events from Kafka and train recommendation models.
  - MLflow tracks experiments, hyperparameters, and model metrics.
  - Updated recommendations are stored in Redis for low-latency serving.

## 📦 **Endpoints**

| Endpoint   | Method | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/search`  | GET    | Fetch product data & personalized recommendations |
| `/track`   | POST   | Track user clickstream events                     |
| `/analyze` | GET    | Fetch real-time analytics data                    |

## 🧪 **Recommendation Flow**

1. Users interact with the frontend → clickstream events sent to `/track`.
2. Go API produces these events to Kafka.
3. Offline Ray jobs consume events → train/update recommendation models.
4. MLflow tracks metrics & experiments.
5. Updated recommendations are saved to Redis.
6. Frontend requests `/search` → Go API retrieves recommendations from Redis.

---

## 📊 **Real-Time Analytics Flow**

1. Clickstream events are cached and aggregated in Redis.
2. Frontend queries `/analyze` to get real-time stats (e.g., trending products, active users).
